# CSE676_FinalProject
final project submission for CSE676 Deep Learning
Project Submission By:
- Veer Bains (50363319)
- Kunal Beniwal (50381672)

Instructions to run code:
- Install requirements.txt
- Download FER2013 Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013
- Run "Human EMotion Detection.ipynb" for model training and evaluation, and change PATH variable in first cell to the path to FER2013 dataset csv file
- Run "emotion_detection_demo.py" to check live model recognition on trained model. Change PATH variable to point to "full_final_model.pt" or other newly trained model as needed
